**Problem 13**: The digital age has made it easier than ever for misinformation, untruths, and fake news to spread rapidly, especially through video content. For all publishers, including social media platforms, this poses a significant challenge to maintain trust and credibility.

**Challenge Objective**: Develop a solution that enhances the trustworthiness of video content by

- Establishing and Maintaining Credentials: Create a system that verifies and tracks the credentials of content creators and sources within the video supply chain.
- Ensuring Attribution: Implement a mechanism to easily establish the original source and attribution of video content.
- Detecting Tampering: Develop a method to identify if video content has been altered or manipulated in any way.

**Scope**: Focus on video content, as it is heavily consumed and a primary medium for spreading misinformation.

## Theory

[How false news can spread?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSKGa_7XJkg) - TedX youtube video

1. Motive?

- Generating engagement for financial and social incentive
- Spreading propaganda
- invoking unrestness

False news can spread through circular reporting, where one source publishes misinformation that is picked up by another news outlet, who cites the original source as evidence that the information is accurate. This continues as other news outlets report the misinformation and perpetuate the cycle.

2. Why do people fall for fake news?

- Lack of deliberation: Individuals do not take the time and energy to deliberate over the accuracy of the news they are exposed to
- Repeated exposure: People tend to familiarize and believe things when they are overexposed towards it.
- Noveltt: Fake news are deemed to be often more novel than true news, and inspires strong emotions such as fear, disgust, and surprise. Novel information grabs our attention and gives us the impression that we are updating our knowledge of the world, thus serving to encourage its spread.
