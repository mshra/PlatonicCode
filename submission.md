### How does your project solve this challenge?
PlatonicCode addresses the challenge of improving the learning experience for students by providing an interactive and engaging platform. Instead of simply delivering answers, the AI-powered chatbox guides students through problem-solving processes, helping them build a deeper understanding of coding concepts. By directing students toward finding their own solutions, PlatonicCode encourages critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Additionally, the integrated code editor allows students to practice coding problems directly on the platform, combining real-time assistance with hands-on coding practice.

### Why is GenAI the best way to solve it?

GenAI is the ideal solution because of its ability to mimic the Socratic method of teaching, which encourages learning through questions rather than direct answers. By leveraging advanced language models, the AI can provide tailored guidance to each student, adapting to their learning style and offering hints without giving away the solution. This promotes self-reliance and a deeper understanding of the material. Furthermore, GenAI can scale easily to support thousands of users, ensuring that each student receives personalized attention and guidance, enhancing the overall learning experience.
